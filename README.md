# Keypoints Extraction From Mediapipe

This repository demonstrates how to extract keypoints from images or videos using Google's [Mediapipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) library. Mediapipe provides efficient solutions for extracting landmarks from human faces, hands, poses, and more, which can be applied in computer vision applications like gesture recognition, motion analysis, and augmented reality.

## Features

- Keypoint extraction for face, hands, and pose landmarks.
- Easy-to-use Python scripts for extracting landmarks from images and videos.
- Visualization of detected keypoints using Matplotlib or OpenCV.
- Modular and extensible code structure for integration with other projects.
